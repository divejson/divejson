# Changelog

Notable changes to the DiveJSON specification and its conformance suite. The specification's own
version (`major.minor`, declared in every document) is what readers and writers depend
on; the implementations that read and write it are released separately, from their own
repositories.

## Unreleased

- Initial draft of the DiveJSON 1.0 specification, its JSON Schema (2020-12), the
  conformance fixtures, and the `divejson validate` CLI. The draft freezes as v1.0 when
  its maintainers tag it.
- `divejson convert` reads UDDF. The format has only ever met the implementation that
  wrote it, and reading somebody else's data is the thing it exists for — so the converter
  is as much a test of the specification as a tool: it is what turns "an open interchange
  format" from a claim with one implementation behind it into one that has read a file it
  did not write. Its rules are written down separately, in `docs/uddf-mapping.md`, because
  the portable part of a converter is its rules; every fixture in the new `fixtures/uddf/`
  is paired with the document it must produce, which makes that directory a conformance
  suite for converters rather than a set of samples. The unit conversions are where a
  converter is most exposed, and no fixture here can reach them: a wrong factor produces a
  document that passes every check the corpus makes and describes a dive nobody took, so
  the tests that cover them belong to the implementation.
- Training courses (§6.17): a `courses` collection, with `course_uuid` links on dives
  and certifications, following the reference implementation shipping them — the draft
  absorbing pre-freeze additions is the policy working as intended.
- `profile.duration` spans the profile's **samples**, and an event `time` may fall past
  it (§6.4, §3 rule 3). The previous rule required `duration` to cover the latest event
  as well, which no dive computer guarantees: a marker button pressed at the surface
  after the recorder's final sample produces exactly that document, and the old rule
  forced a writer either to drop the marker or to invent a sample span the file never
  had — the second forbidden by §5.4. §6.4 now states the reader's obligation positively:
  preserve such an event where it is, and clip when plotting rather than rescaling.
- The tools moved out. The Python implementation — the validator, the UDDF converter and
  the `conform` runner — now lives in
  [divejson/divejson-py](https://github.com/divejson/divejson-py) and is released to PyPI as
  `divejson`; this repository keeps the specification, the schema, the fixtures and the
  documents, and its CI installs a pinned release to run them. What a repository holding
  both could do in one pull request, an amendment now takes two — the price of a format
  that expects ports, and of an implementation with no privileged standing over the suite
  it is measured against. `docs/converting.md` is new: the converter rules that hold
  whatever the source is, lifted out of `docs/uddf-mapping.md`, which keeps what is UDDF's.
